# Question
Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{
  name: "Zo",
  isCool: true,
  age: 28
}
```

# Answer
The code isn't valid JSON because it doesn't use double quotes. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation thats used for APIs and Configs.

# Teacher Feedback

To be specific, the double quotes should go on the keys!
